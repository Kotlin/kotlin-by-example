=== Loops

[source,kotlin]
----
val cakes = listOf("carrot", "cheese", "chocolate")

for (cake in cakes) { <1>
    println("Yummy, it's a $cake cake!")
}
----
<1> Loops through each cake in the list


[source,kotlin]
----

    class Animal(val name: String)

    class Zoo(val animals: List<Animal>) {

        operator fun iterator(): Iterator<Animal> { <1>
            return animals.iterator() <2>
        }
    }

    val zoo = Zoo(listOf(Animal("zebra"), Animal("lion")))

    for (animal in zoo) { <3>
        println("Watch out, it's a $animal")
    }

----
<1> Providing an iterator implementation (marked with operator modifier).
<2> Returns the iterator for the list, which meets the method requirements
    1. next(): Animal
    2. hasNext(): Boolean
<3> Loops through each animal in the zoo

The iterator can be declared on the type or as an extension function.


[source,kotlin]

var cakesEaten = 0
var cakesBaked = 0

while (cakesEaten < 10) {  <1>
    eatACake()
    cakesEaten ++
}

do { <2>
    bakeACake()
    cakesBaked++
} while (cakesBaked < cakesEaten)

----
While and do-while constructs work similarly to most languages.

<1> Performs the block while the condition is false
<2> Performs the block first, and then loops while evaluating the while condition.
