=== String Templates

[source,kotlin]
----
var greeting = "Kotliner"

println("Hello $greeting") <1>
//Prints 'Hello Kotliner'

println("Hello ${insertMe.toUpperCase()}") <2>
//Prints 'Hello KOTLINER'
----

<1> ``String``s in Kotlin can include references on variables, whose values are concatenated into the string.
<2> Besides simple variable references, it is also possible to include more complex evaluations, which then need to be expressed in curly braces.

Template expressions always start with a dollar sign ($).
