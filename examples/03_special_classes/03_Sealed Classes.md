# Sealed Classes

[Sealed classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sealed-classes.html) let you restrict the use of inheritance. Once you declare a class sealed, nobody else can create its subclasses.

```kotlin
sealed class Mammal(val name: String)                                                   // 1

class Cat(val catName: String) : Mammal(catName)                                        // 2
class Human(val humanName: String, val job: String) : Mammal(humanName)

fun greetMammal(mammal: Mammal): String {
    when (mammal) {                                                                     // 3
        is Human -> return "Hello ${mammal.name}; You're working as a ${mammal.job}"    // 4
        is Cat -> return "Hello ${mammal.name}"                                         // 5     
    }                                                                                   // 6
}

fun main() {
    println(greetMammal(Cat("Snowy")))
}
```

1. Defines a sealed class. 
2. Defines subclasses. Note that all subclasses must be in the same file.
3. Uses an instance of the sealed class as an argument in a `when` expression. 
4. A smartcast is performed, casting `Mammal` to `Human`.
5. A smartcast is performed, casting `Mammal` to `Cat`.
6. The `else`-case is not necessary here since all possible subclasses of the sealed class are covered. With a non-sealed superclass `else` would be required.
