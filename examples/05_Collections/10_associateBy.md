# associateBy, groupBy

Functions `associateBy` and `groupBy` build maps from the elements of a collection indexed by the specified key. The key is defined in the `keySelector` parameter.
You can also specify an optional `valueSelector` to define what will be stored in the `value` of the map element.

The difference between `associateBy` and `groupBy` is how they process objects with the same key:
* `associateBy` uses the last suitable element as the value.
* `groupBy` builds a list of all suitable elements and puts it in the value. 

The returned map preserves the entry iteration order of the original collection.

1. Defines a data class that describes a person.
2. Defines a collection of people.
3. Builds a map from phone numbers to their owners' information. `it.phone` is the `keySelector` here. The `valueSelector` is not provided, so the values of the map are `Person` objects themselves.
4. Builds a map from phone numbers to the cities where owners live. `Person::city` is the `valueSelector` here, so the values of the map contain only cities. 
5. Builds a map that contains cities and people living there. The values of the map are lists of person names.
