# flatMap

`flatMap` transforms each element of a collection into an iterable object and builds a single list of the transformation results. The transformation is user-defined. 

<div class="language-kotlin" theme="idea" data-min-compiler-version="1.3">

```kotlin
fun main() {

//sampleStart
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3)                        // 1

    val tripled = numbers.flatMap { listOf(it, it, it) } // 2
//sampleEnd

    println("Numbers: $numbers")
    println("Transformed: $tripled")
}
```

</div>

1. Defines a collection of numbers.
2. Builds a list in which every collection element is repeated three times. Important thing is that it's **not** a list of lists; it's a list of integers with nine elements.
